# Code-For-Sparta-Global
VHDL code used in final year project
This code was written as part of my final year project to implement a hearing device for individuals with sensitive hearing.
The end goal was to implement a digital filtering algorithm to reduce to volume of chosen frequency bands.
Originally this was attempted on an Arduino Uno however it was found this was not viable.
Due to this I switched to development on an FPGA board, I has a working input and an output with a fixed volume control
I began work on the digital filters however due to time constrainsts was unable to implement these however the code I developed is included.
I developed all the code except the SPI interface in the pmodmicrefcomp file, this was written by someone else and slightly changed for my use.
